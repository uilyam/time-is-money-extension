# Time is Money Extension

Time is Money is a Google Chrome extension I wrote as I found myself tracking my time more often and checking out numerous apps on the market.  This is by no means a replacement for those, just a fun excuse to brush up on my Google Chrome extension skills and learn about the Bulma.css framework and Luxon datetime library.

#### Current Funcationality

- Start and stop the timer.
- Sync with your Google account across browsers/computers.
- Resumes state after closing and opening.

#### Tech Stack

- React
- Bulma.css
- Luxon

#### Ideas for Future Functionality

- Pausing the timer
- Save sessions to be exported to CSV.
- Incorporate an hourly rate to be able to display money made instead of time elapsed.
